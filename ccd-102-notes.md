# SFCC B2C Developer

- 1 Month of sandbox access
- Will provide cert advice at end
- Sandbox Number is `045`


- Actual API is Java
  - JS is running on JRE(?)  in a ruby interpreter
  - No programming actually happens in Java
- Make sure node version `4.0 =<  version < 12.0.0` for CLI exercises

## Slide Notes

### Day 1 - Monday

- Salesforce B2C Commerce Integrations
  - B2C Commerce is not the source if truth for product inventory
- Instances
- B2C Commerce Infrastructure
  - POD: Point of Delivery
    - Salesforce owned, in third party data centers
  - Realm: Within POD
    - Cannot communicate directtly with each other
    - Must import/export
    - PIG: Primary Instance Group
      - Development, Staging, Production
      - Code typically not transferred directly from sandbox to staging
        - Typically stored in and pushed from VCS
    - SIG: Secondary Instance Group
      - Realm Sandboxes
      - Demo Sandbox
        - Automatically wiped and reloaded every release with a fresh copy of Site Genesis and SFRA
        - Can always compare with a vanilla version of the code, in case of bugs on a sandbox
        - Can be used for initial integration testing (before staging), but should be temporary
  - Typically 8-16 releases a year, never in the fourth quarter
- Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA)
  - OOB Blueprint
- SFRA Cartridge Stack
  - Whenever possible, go through SFRA
  - Can alter SFRA core codebase, but shouldn't if at all possible
    - Salesforce will not help with issues arising from this
  - If multiple sites share branding, separate common functionality and site specific functionality
- Model View Controller (MVC) Architectural Pattern
  - Promotes modular and maintainable coe
  - Pattern, not requirement
- Business Manager
  - 15 minute inactivity timeout for login
    - For PCI Compliance
    - BM doesn't know if BM is connected to a Sandbox or Production
  - DWithEase (Demandware with Ease)  
    - Not officially recommended
    - Used to bypass logout timer
    - Only use in sandbox, bypassing 15min logout violates PCI
  - Sandboxes are white on black, prod is red
- Knowledge Check
  - Name the architectural pattern of SFRA
    - MVC
  - Two BM features
    - Import/export data, update products, update content slots
- Break
- 2-1: Access SFRA
  - Typically site imports only import data
  - SFRA import is unique in that it imports data + code
- Storefront & Master Catalog Structure
  - Each storefront has
    - One or more master catalogs
    - One storefront catalog
      - Defines the navigation for the site
- 2-2: Share catalog data between sites
  - ids are case sensitive
  - New site name will appear in URL, encoded (%20 for spaces)
  - Changes will not be posted until `apply` button is pressed
    - Salesforce screens will give warning if there are unsaved changes
    - Demandware screens will not display a warning
  - Brand new site will have the demandware base code if nothing else is deployed (green background with salesforce logo)
  - Categories in storefront catalog define site navigation
    - Categories are actually `Search-Show?gid=CATEGORY_ID`
    - Empty categories do not appear in navigation
      - Empty search does not generate category page
- 2-4
- Knowledge Check
  - SFRA code can be accessed through Github
    - True
  - You do not need to rebuild search indexes for a site
    - False
- Cartridge
  - What is a cartridge?
    - A folder with a set of resources
  - Provides specific storefront features or integrations
  - Has specific subfolders for different types of resources
- Cartridge Directory Structure
  - Compiled/minified js/scss is sent to `static` directory
  - No sub directories in `controllers` directory
  - Any JS that isn't a controller or model goes in the scripts folder
    - Helpers, etc.
- Cartridge Path
  - Determines what gets executed in what order
- Cartridge Execution
  - Cartridges are prioritized in left to right order
- Cartridge Path COnsiderations
  - Plugins are developed against the base cart, not each other
    - May contain conflicting code
      - `plugin_catrdridge_merge` handles conflicts between plugin cartridges
      - Included by default in all-in-one code base from BM
      - Unlikely to happen in LINK carts, but may
        - Try to use unique name spaces
- SFRA Modules
  - Uses CommonJS for common functionality
- 3-1: Work with Plugin Cartridges
  - lib_productlist is required for wishlist and gift registry plugins
  - To uninstall a plugin (such as wishlist) disable it in the custom preferences and remove it from the cartridge path
- 3-3: Create a New Code Version
  - For dw.json password, use WebDAV access key instead of actual password
  - To upload catrridges with pro
    - `Prophet (Cloud Icon) > More Actions... > Prophet: Enable Upload`
- Knowledge Check
  - What are the two main directories you'll  find in the SFRA
    - Modules
  - Why is the order of the cartridges on the cartridge path
important?
    - Determines the precedence of functionality
- Controller
  - Server side script that handles requests
  - Manages data flow in application
  - Written in JS and B2C commerce script
- B2C Commerce  Script
  - Based on JS
    - Used in controllers and ISML Templates
      - Not recommended  to use directly in template
  - When one says "B2C Commerce Script", it means a script that accesses the API
- require paths
  - `~/` Look in root of cart
  - `*/` Look in cartridge path
  - `./` Look in current directory
  - `../` Look in parent directory
  - `dw/` Look in scripts API
  - `server` get server object
- Server Module
  - Every controller must end with `next();`
    - Controllers are middleware, next calls next function in chain
    - Can also pass along errors with `next(new Error())`
- Types of routes
  - `server.use` responds to both `GET` and `POST` requests
    - Not found in base cart
- Add Middleware Functions
  - `req`
    - Used when looking for input information
  - `res`
    - Used for outputting information
  - `next`
    - Calls next function in chain
- 4-1
  - Pipeline not found error
    - Indicates that controller was not found, so SFRA looked for pipeline (which was also not found)
- Passing parameters
  - res.render() has two arguments
    - Template
    - Parameters to pass into pdict
  - `${}` Indicates an expression, with the contents of the braces being evaluated
- Troubleshooting
  - Ensure cartridge directories are within the `cartridges` directory 
    - This is where prophet will expect to find them
  - Ensure local code version matches live code version
  - Cartridge path names are case sensitive
  - Check cache settings, ensure it's disabled
  - Check indexes
  - Make sure that all files are saved and uploaded
- 4-3
  - Request Log
    - Under `toolkit` in BM
    - `Clear` does not clear entire request log, only what is currently displayed on the page
- 4-4
- superModule
  - Allows for extending of javascript modules
  - References the same module in a different cartridge
    - Cartridge is the next cart to the right on the cart path
  - This is how multiple controllers can run code on the same request (middleware)
  - superModule options
    - append
      - Inserts functionality after original functionality
    - prepend
      - Inserts functionality before original functionality
    - replace
      - Completely replaces original middleware
- 4-6
  - If using `res.getViewData()`, `res.setViewData()` is not required
    - viewData is passed by referenced
  - `setViewData()` appends viewData, it does not replace the object
- 4-7
- B2C Commerce Script API
  - Sandboxes updated at least two weeks before PIG instances
  - Updated documentation included with update
  - Version number included in BM
  - Can set site for earlier version compatibility if not using current features
- B2C Commerce API Packages
  - Two types
    - Storefront
      - Has to do with campaigns, catalogs, orders
    - Background
      - Behind the scenes
- Product Factories
  - Access API through models instead of directly
### Day 2 - Tuesday
- 4-8
- Knowledge Check
  - Controllers must conform to B2C Commerce module
standard
    - False, commerce module standard does not exist
    - Exam won't have intentionally trick questions like this
  - Middleware chaining allows you to extend routes
without having to rewrite them
    - True
- Model
  - Converts API objects to serializable JSON
  - Applies business logic during conversion, so data is in a usable format
    - e.g. Price may be affected by current promotions
- 5-1
  - All decorators can be imported at once by importing `decorators/index.js`
  - `module.superModule` and `base.call` allow for extending models without editing the base cart
- 5-2
  - Revisit later
- Extend a model with a new decorator
  - Revisit later
- Knowledge Check
  - How can you extend a model when no decorator
pattern is used?
    - Use `superModule` and `.call()`
  - Can you give another example for when you may want
to extend or create a new model?
    - Size guides for clothing products
- ISML
  - Internet Store Markup Language
  - Generates HTML
  - .isml
- 6-1
  - Prophet's tag completion ignores starting brace
    - `issl` > `<isslot>`
    - `<issl` > `<<isslot>
  - Comments
    - HTML comments `<!-- -->` are sent to browser
    - ISML comments `<iscomment>` are never sent to browser
    - To comment out a script, use isml comments. HTML comments will not stop isscript from running
  - `<isscript` is not linted
  - Best Practice: Only use isscript to load client side css and js
    - Scripting should be done in controller, with output passed to template
  - `<isprint>`
    - Prints output, formated based on localization settings
- Template Decorator
  - Used to add headers and footers to page, similar to Shopify layout
  - `<isreplace/>` Replaced by page content
- Types of Template Decorators
  - Page
    - Includes navigation
  - Checkout
    - Does not include navigation
    - OOB, only used in checkout
- Best Practices for Other ISML Tags in SFRA
  - Control logic should take place in the controller, instead of isml templates
    - Exception: setting cache for content slots
      - Content slot controller is located SFCC server side, no access
- ISML Expressions
  - `${}`
- The Top Level Package
  - Implicitly included, never needs to be imported
  - Implicitly used, not mentioned in expressions
- The dw.web Package
  - Also implicitly included
- Creating and accessing variables
  - `<isset>`
    - Don't do business logic here
    - Attributes
      - name
      - value
      - scope
        - Recommended to use page, defaults to session
  - Retrieval syntax by scope
    - Included templates can retrieve variables if within scope
  - Variable Attributes
  - Conditional Statements and Loops
  - Loops
    - `<isloop>`
      - Loops through itemsin collection or array
      - Can break and continue  loops
  - Status Variable Properties
  - 6-4
  - Remote Includes
    - Never hard code URLs, use URLUtils to build url instead
      - URLs change depending on the server, each sandbox, staging, dev, and prod will have its own URLs
    - Remote include content can have different cache settings than the page it appears on
      - e.g. Search results/product tile order can't be cached, but the product tiles themselves can be
    - URLUtils.url will automatically try to route to `Start` if route is not included
      - `URLUtils.url('Basket')` == `URLUtils.url('Basket-Start')`
- Resource API and Resource Bundles
  - Used in place of hardcoded strings
  - Allows for i18n
  - `.properties` extension
  - Named by functional area
  - Located in `cartridges/${cart_name}/cartridge/templates/resources`
  - Fallback
    - ISO country codes are all caps
    - ISO lang codes are all lowercase
    - First, server looks in account_fr_FR.properties for key value pair (if present)
    - If not found, next account_fr.properties is checked (if present)
    - If not found, next account.properties is checked  (if present)
    - If not found, then it gives up
  - Add variables to translation
    - Values passed in, referenced by index
    - Key Value pair: `label.number.items.in.cart={0} Items`
    - Reference in model: `Resource.msgf('label.number.items.in.cart', 'cart', null, this.numItems)`
    - Result: `10 items`
- Using a Resource Bundle
  - `Resource.msg`
    - Used when there are no variables
    - `Resource.msg('key.in.resource.file', 'resource_file', 'default text')`
  - `Resource.msgf`
    - Used when there are variables
    - `Resource.msgf('key.in.resource.file', 'resource_file', 'default text', Parameter1)`
  - Use default text?
    - If used, prevents nonsense text from appearing on site
    - If not used, output text may erroneously pass QA because it appears correct
- 6-6
  - Locales must be enabled on a per-store basis
  - Locales can be added in BM if not already present
  - Empty fields in Regional Settings will default to Java defaults
- Content Slots
  - Types
    - Product (shows products, merchant selected)
    - Category
    - Asset
    - HTML
    - Recommendations (shows products, einstein selected)
- Content Slot Contexts

    - Does not care what is actually placed there
    - Defined with code
  - Asset
    - Non-configurable
    - Requires no coding
  - Creating and Configuring Content Slots
    - Developer creates slot in ISML
      - `<isslot id description context>`
    - Developer creates slot rendering template
      - Not template for page
      - Defines how content slot is displayed
      - Within `templates/default/slots` directory
    - Merchant configures slot
      - Configured in BM
      - Slot template determined by content type selected in BM
- Developer Creates a Content Slot
  - Description field must be present, even if empty
    - Global slot
      - `context="global"`
    - Category Slot
      - `context="category"`
      - `context-object="${pdict.category}"`
        - Pass current category into content slot
- Developer Creates a Slot Rendering Template
  - `slotcontent` belongs to `Toplevel.global`
- 6-7 Create a Content Slot
- Merchant Creates a Content Slot Configuration
  - Einstein recommendations can be set on staging/dev/prod, not sandbox
- Using Content Link Functions
  - Functions
    - $staticlink$
    - $url$
    - $httpUrl$
    - $httpsUrl$
    - $include$
  - Behind the scenes, each function utilizes URLUtils
    - Format makes script html safe
  - Example
    - `href="$url('Page-Show', 'cid', '2-day-shipping-popup')$"`
- 6-8
  - When uploading an image for a content slot, select it by clicking on the image title instead of clicking select

    - Published?
    - Set to visible in current locale?
    - All visibility rules apply?
      - Schedule matches
      - Customer Group Matches
  - Pages with visibility rules should not be cached
    - Caching is for pages visible for everyone
  - Render page needs a second argument, even if it's empty
- Cartridge Files and Folder Structure
### Day 3 - Wednesday
- 6-11
  - js and json go in `experience/components/commerce assets`
  - template goes in `templates/experience/components/commerce_assets`
- 6-12
  - `Page-Show?cid=salepage` can be used to access a page designer page without a custom controller
    - Ensure no additional functionality is needed beyond what is in the Page-Show controller
- Knowledge Check
  - When should you use the <isscript> tag?
    - Only if you have custom static JS or static css
  - What contexts of content slots can you create?
    - global
    - category
  - Can a slot be created in Business Manager?
    - No, must be created in code
  - How are types defined in Page Designer?
    - In asset json and js files, along with isml template
- System and Custom Objects
  - Extensibility can be viewed under 
  - Attributes with padlock are system defined
  - Those without are custom, and are defined for a specific site
  - Object types can be thought of as DB tables
    - Attributes can be thought of as a table column
    - Each instance of an object can be thought of as a table row
  - Attribute boost factor affects text relevance
    - Ignored when not sorting by text relevance
  - About Custom Objects
  - Considerations for using Custom Objects
    - Can be site or organization specific
    - Best for small amounts of static data
    - Ideally, custom objects should have fewer than 100 rows
      - Querying slows after 100 rows
      - Actual quota is 40,000 rows
  - Defining a Custom Object Type
    - Key attribute can be thought of as primary key
    - Data replication option determines if data can be included in replication
      - Object definition will be replicated regardless of setting
      - Use replicable if config needs to be input in staging and transferred to prod
      - Use not replicable if used to collect data
        - e.g. Tracking whether customer is subscribed to newsletter
      - Retention can only be set if data is not replicable
        - Based on last modified timestamp
        - Think of this setting as an expiration date
        - If retention date is exceeded, nightly system job will remove data from custom object table
      - Minimum of four attributes
        - UUID
        - Creation Date
        - id
        - Last Modified
      - Don't use mandatory fields if creating objects programmatically
        - Initial creation will fail, since only id is inserted
- Inheritance tree
  - dw.object.SystemObject is not an actual class
    - Just a representation of a system object
- Creating Custom Objects Programmatically
  - Name of key column does not need to be specified, only value
    - Column will be automatically detected
  - `UUIDUtils.createUUID()` returns a string
- Form Components
  - Form Definition
  - Controller for rendering form and handling form input
    - Two routes
  - Script to create custom object
  - ISML template
- Database Transaction Handling
  - Implicit
    - Automatically starts transaction
    - Commits or rolls back based on B2C commerce
  - Explicit
    - Transaction controlled in script
    - Commit/Roll back handled by script
- Implicit
  - `Transaction.wrap()`
    - will commit if completed without a runtime error
    - will roll back if there is a runtime error
- Explicit
  - `Transaction.begin()`
    - `Transaction.commit()` will commit transaction
    - `Transaction.rollback()` will rollback transaction
    - May be in a try/catch or if/else to determine when to commit or roll back
- Object Interaction
  - Form framework is built for data that needs to be persisted
  - For data that does not need to be persister, framework is overkill
    - Non-persisting data only requires an html form
- XMl Metadata File
  - Forms can be included in other forms, similar to `<isinclude>`
  - localized strings in `forms.xml` will be searched for in `forms.properties`
    - Resource file name does not need to be specified
  - Try not to hardcode required attribute
- 7-2 > 7-7
  - Redo this exercise to make sure it's understood
- Enable Custom Logging
  - Severity Level
    - Fatal
    - Error
    - Warn
    - Info
    - Debug
  - Messages are visible for currently selected severity and above
    - Error will display Error and Fatal, etc.
    - If a parent is set to a lopwer value, the child will inherit that setting
      - e.g. if `product` is set to info and `product.bundles` is set to debug, `product.bundles` will be set to info
    - Custom error logs come from carts
    - Error logs come from system
- Writing a Custom Log
  - `dw.system.Logger.getLogger`
    - Only way to create a log category
    - Possible to not use getLogger, but can't create category
  - Maximum number of log files per day
    - Exceeding limit will throw a runtime error
- Custom Logging COnsiderations
  - In production
    - Logs are captured daily
    - After 5 days, logs are moved to archive
    - After 30 days, loga are deleted
  - Sandbox logs are not archived
    - Deleted after 5 days
  - File size limit of 10mb per log file
    - Once hit, no more messages are stored
    - Deleting files does not affect this
    - B2C remembers how big the old file was, and will not surpass 10mb total
  - One day is midnight to midnight
- 7-7
- Using System Objects
  - Use `Externally Managed` attribute property for attributes that are from an external database
    - Only affects merchant tools
- 7-8
- Client Side Javascript
  - Directory
    - `cartridge/client/default/js`
  - `plugin-newsletter` is an example of client side validation
- Knowledge check
  - The Form Definition describes the data you need from
the form and the system objects you want to use.
    - False
      - The form definition just specifies the form structure
  - Extending an existing system object by adding new
attributes is preferable to creating a new custom
object.
    - True
      - Only use a custom object if it's the only option
### Day 4 - Thursday
- Hooks, Jobs, and Ocapi
  - Higher level topics
  - Recent (part of class for less than 4 months)
- Hook
  - Think of it as an event listener
  - OCAPI
    - Built in hook points, called every time a particular API is called
      - e.g. Every time a shopping cart is posted
      - pre/post hooks
      - Hook script order not guaranteed
- Hook definition
  - need to be defined in `hooks.json`
    - Specifies hook name and script
    - Convention to name it `app.` for app hooks, and `integration.` for integration hooks
  - `package.json` indicates where to find `hooks.json`
- 8-1
  - Emails can use ISML templates
- OCAPI
  - Shop API
    - Used for Shop data
    - Customer specific data
  - Data API

    - `()` Is in the wrong location on the SG slide
- Client ID
  - Every request needs a client ID
  - Every sandbox has a test client ID of 30 a's in a row
- OCAPI Settings
  - Each site can have different actions exposed
  - `BM > Admin > SiteDev > OCAPI Settings`
  - Can be defined per site or globally
    - Typically Data API global, since DB is global
    - Typically Shop API is store based
- Jobs
  - Used to automate tasks
  - Can be both custom or use OOB functionality
  - Sandboxe jobs can only run manually
- Job Flows
  - Sequential jobs run top to bottom
  - Parallel jobs run at the same time
- Job Flow Scope
  - Organization

  - Job Statistics
  - Jobs (Deprecated)
    - Allows for managing/running out of date jobs on older systems
  - Job History lists jobs by individual run
  - Job Statistics aggregates jobs by job type
- 8-6
- Knowledge Check
  - Where is the location of the hooks.json mentioned?
    - `package.json`
  - What is the difference between a hook and controller?
    - Controllers are triggered by URL, hooks are triggered like an event
      - OCAPI hooks can run in response to server events
    - Controller routes in multiple carts get overwritten, hooks in multiple carts all get called
    - Controllers can call hooks
  - Which OCAPI HTTP method creates or replaces a
resource?
    - `put`
  - Where do you go to monitor the duration and number
of executions for jobs?
    - `BM > Admin > Operations > Job Statistics`
- Site and Page Caching
  - `res.cachePeriod`
  - `res.cachePeriodUnit`
  - `res.personalized`
    - Indicates that this page has multiple versions/personalized content
      - Not personal (account specific), but may include displaying promos to limited groups
    - Adds overhead, only use when actually needed
- Recommendations
  - Disable on sandboxes, development, and staging
  - Shorten cache on rapidly changing pages
- 9-1
  - Routes are cached, not templates
  - Cache is set by URL
- Site Performance: Pipeline Profiler
- Site performance: Code Profiler
- SFRA Tooling
- 9-5
- Knowledge Check
  - What is the default cache setting?
    - 24 hours
  - Where do you change the value for cache?
    - In the controller
  - Are SFRA Tools available when you access the code
  from Business Manager?
    - No, it's only available  from Github
- Bonus: Certification Exam
  - Tom helped write it!
  - Retakes
    - CAn retake an unlimited number of times
      - 1st take
      - 1st retake has no time limit

    - These were the things determined to be essential to the developer job
      - 1 week
    - Then questions were made from the tasks
      - Another 1 week
    - All questions are based on this job task analysis
      - This is the basis for all Salesforce exams
    - These are for the minimally qualified candidates
      - Designed for someone who's been doing this a few months
      - Goal: to separate between a qualified Cand and an unqualified Cand
  - Audience Description: Salesforce B2C Commerce Developer
    - Describes the kinds of things a minimally qualified candidate should be able to do
    - Doesn't talk about questions, but this is the job that they are trying to test for
    - No explicit github questions, but it's expected that a full time dev can use it
  - Ignore the typical job titles
    - Irrelevant
  - About the Exam
    - 60 multiple choice (radio button),  multi select (checkbox), or matching questions
      - No matching questions, as of yet (Tom is pretty sure)
      - No short answer questions
      - No writing code
      - Just recognize the correct answer
      - For multi select
